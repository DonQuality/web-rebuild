Hello!!!

  So the assigment was to rebuild a website, so i randomly picked one. That way i teach my self how to improve my work by not looking for a specific simple website.
  Anyway i just used:

  -header

  -div's

  -article

  -table

  -h1

  -h2

  -paragraph <Tags>
  etc.

  And used CSS to give my HTML some style. It is very simple and i apologize for the way that i am explaining this to you, i know you're smart enough to understand!!!...
  Also the page that i used was www.fancy.com </>
