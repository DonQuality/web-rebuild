Hello!!!

  So the assigment was to rebuild a website, so i randomly picked one. That way i teach my self how to improve my work by not looking for a specific simple one.
  Anyway i just used:

  <header></header>

  <div></div>

  <article></article>

  <table></table>

  <h1></h1>

  <h2></h2>

  <p></p>....

  etc.
  And used CSS to give my HTML style. It is very simple and i apologize for the way that i am explaining this to you, i know u got it!!!...
  Also the page that i used was www.fancy.com </>
